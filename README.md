Assessment of Motorized Two-Wheeler Riders' Perceptions of Road Safety and Infrastructure Demands in Mixed Traffic Conditions Using Machine Learning Technique



## Introduction
Indian residents primarily commute on urban roads using motorized two-wheelers (MTWs), even though MTW fatality rates are significantly high in India. Identifying riders' views of road safety under mixed traffic conditions is therefore crucial. This study conducted an online questionnaire survey that contained MTW rider’s socio-demography, travel information, driving styles, insight into safety-perception and infrastructural demands. K-Means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were done to categorize respondents as per socio-demography and investigate their driving characteristics and riding preferences on urban roads. Five Principal Components were generated from each dataset after dimension reduction using PCA. These are component 1 (Traffic Laws Enforcement), component 2 (Risk Taking Behaviour), component3 (Erratic Manoeuvres’),component 4 (Safety Measures) and component 5 (Driving under Influence).Multinomial Logistic Regression was done to relate PCA components with socio-demographic clusters.This study also used socio-demographic data and machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor and Logistic Regression) to predict preferences for two-wheeler infrastructural demands. Evaluation metrics were applied to assess model performance.  Results showed that MTW riders lack knowledge of wearing helmets or stopping at red signals. Around 40% male riders commute under stress, involved in overtaking, riding between other vehicles in congested areas, and using footpaths to avoid traffic. Regarding infrastructural need, 82% of riders recommend mandating dedicated motorcycle lanes. The study outcome provides a comprehensive understanding of motorcyclists' safety perceptions, behaviour, and infrastructure demands, which will help policymakers choose the best future infrastructure for improving motorists’ safety in urban settings.
## About Dataset
### Data Collection
Data used in this study was collected through a self-administered, closed end online questionnaire survey that was prepared using a wide spectrum of questions to collect the maximum possible relevant information from the urban two-wheeler users. These are related to safe driving practices, road safety education, and their psychological and behavioral aspects while riding at different traffic facilities. It was circulated among people of different backgrounds to create a diverse sample size. The questionnaire consisted of a total of 27 questions and includes two sections: the first is ‘socio-demographic data’ (age, gender, occupation, driving frequency, driving experience) and the second section is ‘motorists’ perception’ towards vivid factors influencing the road safety of motorized two-wheelers riding on urban areas.

## Descriptive Statistics of the Sample
The sample collected through the questionnaire survey was comprised of 70.1% male and 29.9% female respondents. Among all the respondents, young adult male drivers aged between 18 and 30 who commute daily for private employment or education constitute a large portion of the sample. As per past studies, male and young inexperienced drivers are more likely to be involved in risky activities such as excessive speeding, distracted driving, and driving while intoxicated, resulting in traffic accidents(48). Hence, in this study, young drivers were approached to participate in this survey.
## Methodology
### 1. Clustering of the Demographic of Drivers :
This study employed K-means cluster analysis to group user responses based on their socio-demographic data. Utilizing the elbow chart was crucial in determining the optimal number of clusters for the analysis. The elbow chart that plotting the number of clusters against the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS), quantifying the sum of squared distances between each data point and its corresponding cluster centroid. The selection of an appropriate number of clusters through the elbow chart was essential to ensure the production of meaningful and valuable results. Figure (a) shows the elbow chart for optimum numbers of clusters and Figure (b) visualizes the different cluster group.

### 2. Principal Component Analysis
The motorist’s perception-related data with 15 variables as listed in Table 3 underwent pre-processing before applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce its dimensionality. PCA is a statistical technique utilized to decrease the dimensions of a large dataset while preserving as much of its original variance as possible. It achieves this by creating a new set of orthogonal variables, known as principal components, which capture the maximum variation in the original data. To assess the factorability of the dataset, both Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test and Bartlett's test were conducted. The KMO test yielded a score of 0.639, surpassing the acceptable threshold of 0.5 (49).
Additionally, the p-value obtained from Bartlett's sphericity test was found to be less than 0.05. The number of components to be formed was determined based on the Kaiser criterion, which employs eigenvalues to determine the percentage of variance explained by the components. The Principal Component Analysis was carried out using the 'factor analyzer' package in Python 3.10. The 15 'motorists' perception'-related variables were then grouped using the PCA method and the relationship between components’ numbers and the cumulative explained variance is shown in figure below (a). This figure illustrates that five components collectively account for approximately 61.81% of the cumulative variance, signifying a notable proportion of variance. Hence, the 15 'motorists' perception-related variables were grouped into "five" components based on the maximum component loading. These five different components were assigned a name to facilitate data interpretation, considering the similarity of variables within each component. Another below-mentioned figure (b) shows the scatter plot of the final five PCA components.

### 3. Multinomial Logistic regression (MLR) 
Multinomial logistic regression, a statistical method, was employed in this study to predict the probability of outcomes with more than two categories based on predictor variables. Specifically, multinomial logistic regression models were utilized to analyze the relationship between clusters obtained through cluster analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) components.
Despite both linear and logistic regression being suitable for hypothesis testing to determine model coefficient significance (50), the study favoured logistic regression due to its ability to handle categorical data. The PCA components served as covariates and independent variables, while the K-means cluster analysis findings were considered dependent variables. The MLR coefficients and their corresponding p-values were examined to assess the statistical significance of the relationships.

## DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
The present research investigated the interplay between socio-demographic characteristics, motorists’ perceptions, and infrastructural demands for two-wheelers at urban roads in India. This research stands as the first of its kind in India, providing a comprehensive analysis of public perception towards road safety, particularly emphasising the often-overlooked infrastructural requirements for motorized two-wheelers.
The analysis of distinct driver clusters provided important insights into their driving behaviors and attitudes towards road safety. Considering cluster 1 as a reference cluster, the MLR analysis revealed that cluster 2 (as given in Table 2) had significant associations with two principal components: Component 1 (Traffic Laws Enforcement) and Component 5 (Driving Under Influence). The negative coefficient for Component 1 (-0.5407) suggests that individuals in Cluster 2 exhibit a lower tendency to adhere to traffic laws and regulations, possibly indicating a higher inclination towards risky driving behaviors. On the other hand, the negative coefficient for Component 5 (-0.7797) indicates a reduced probability of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs within this cluster. In this cluster, concerning trends were observed, with 50.42% of respondents never insisting on their co-passengers wearing helmets and 41.9% of drivers disobeying laws that demand strict traffic enforcement. Additionally, 40.33% of respondents occasionally over-speeded their two-wheelers, 65.50% engaged in overtaking while in traffic, and 47.89% admitted to occasionally passing stopped cars at intersections. These behaviours highlight the need for targeted interventions to address risky driving practices within this cluster.
Whereas for Cluster 3, the MLR analysis showed a significant relationship with Component 1 (Traffic Laws Enforcement) and Component 4 (Safety Measures). The negative coefficient for Component 1 (-0.2589) suggests that individuals in Cluster 3 also demonstrate a decreased propensity to comply with traffic laws. However, the negative coefficient for Component 4 (-0.4003) indicates a reduced likelihood of following safety measures while driving. In this cluster, 69.23% of respondents always fastened their helmet belts, while 23.51% only occasionally did so, indicating scope for improvement. On a positive note, 61.53% of respondents never attempted to travel at the maximum speed when driving, suggesting a responsible approach to speed limits within this cluster.
Moreover, for Cluster 4, the MLR analysis revealed significant associations with Component 1 (Traffic Laws Enforcement), Component 2 (Risk-Taking Behavior), and Component 5 (Driving Under the Influence). The negative coefficients for Component 1 (-0.3058) and Component 2 (-0.4085) imply that individuals in Cluster 4 are less inclined to adhere to traffic laws and regulations and exhibit lower risk-taking behaviour while driving. Moreover, the negative coefficient for Component 5 (-0.6292) indicates a reduced probability of driving under the influence. In this cluster, 57.14% of respondents disagreed that speeding up their two-wheelers helped them save time, reflecting a more safety-conscious attitude. Moreover, 82.85% of riders never carried out overtaking manoeuvres while in traffic, and 45.71% never passed stopped cars at signalized intersections, demonstrating cautious driving behaviours. A significantly lower proportion, i.e., 14.28% of respondents sometimes attempted to overtake on horizontal curves, and 22.80% occasionally used shoulders to avoid traffic, indicating potential risk-taking tendencies.
The MLR analysis emphasizes the importance of PCA-identified components for different socio-demographic clusters, shaping road safety views. Targeted safety initiatives considering the unique traits of two-wheeler user groups can enhance overall road safety by addressing specific issues mentioned above. This research provides a comprehensive understanding of motorized two-wheeler safety and infrastructural demands, aiding policymakers, urban planners, and transportation authorities in designing safer road infrastructures and evidence-based safety measures. The study identifies distinct driver clusters with specific driving behaviours and attitudes. Cluster 2 requires interventions for risky driving practices, while Cluster 3 shows better compliance with safety measures but scope for improvement. Cluster 4 exhibits a safety-conscious attitude. Addressing infrastructural demands with dedicated separate lanes and stopping areas (red bike-box) can significantly reduce motorized two-wheeler crashes and enhance road safety. These insights can guide developing strategic policies, reducing motorized two-wheeler-related injuries and accidents on urban roads.
The present study focused on road safety for motorized two-wheeler riders on urban roads, exploring their perceptions and infrastructural needs. This research can be further carried out considering long-distance commuters travelling along inter-urban locations. Additionally, in the future, the effectiveness of two infrastructural facilities, namely separate lanes for two-wheelers and red bike boxes at intersections, can be examined in terms of traffic operation and safety by utilizing simulation tools such as PTV VISSIM, or SUMO applicable for Indian mixed traffic scenario. The simulation outcome could be employed to assess the impact of these facilities on fundamental traffic parameters such as density, flow, capacity, speed, etc. for separate lanes and delay, queuing, saturation flow, arrival-departure rates, start-up loss time, etc. for Red Bike Box at the signalized intersections. These simulations would offer valuable insights into balancing road safety enhancements and optimizing traffic operations, enabling better-informed policy-making for safer and more efficient road systems.
